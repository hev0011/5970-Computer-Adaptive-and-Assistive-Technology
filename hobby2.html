<h1>Cooking</h1>

<h2>What I mainly Cook</h2>
<p>I usually tend to lean towards a 80/20 protein based diet everytime I cook</p>

<h2>My Favorite Meals</h2>
<p>I love to make a medium rare steak, soft boiled eggs, and some sourdough bread.<br>
Another meal I love is honeyglazed lean pork chops with strawberries and softboiled eggs and broccoli.</p>

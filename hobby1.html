<h1>Reading</h1>
<h2>Why I Love Reading</h2>
<p>Reading allows me to escape reality</p>


<h2>My Favorite Series</h2>
<p>My favorite series has to be the Hunger Games and I am glad the author is still writing sequels for the books as well</p>

<p>For the best books I use
    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a> to connect with my friends and reads
</p>

<h2>An Image of Throne of Glass Series (which I also LOVE)</h2>
<p>here is one variation of the cover</p>
